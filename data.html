      <p>	Food loss and waste accounts for about 4,4 giga tons of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) per year. To put this in perspective, if food loss and waste were its own country, it would be the world&#39s third-largest GHG emitter, surpassed only by China and the United States.</p>
      <p>	Every year, consumers in rich countries waste almost as much food (222 million tons) as the entire net food production of sub-Saharan Africa (230 million tons).</p>
      <p> According to research, the produced but unconsumed food accounts for approximately 1.4 billion hectares of land, constituting almost <font size="30"> 1/3 of the planet&#39s agricultural land.</font> The world is wasting 30 percent of the world&#39s fertile land which could be used for other meaningful purposes such as environmental research.</p>
      <p>	Precise estimations indicate that food wastage is responsible for the wastage of nearly 250 cubic km of water (per year). This wastage is equivalent to <font size="30"> thrice the volume </font> of Lake Geneva.</p>
      <p>According to FAO&#39s report estimates, the economic losses associated with food wastage is about $750 billion dollars per annum which is <font size="30"> 16 times </font> the cost of the Louvre Museum including all its paintings and artefacts.</p>
      <p>	The food wasted by the United States and Europe alone could feed the world <font color="red"> 3 times over </font>.</p>
      <p> Per capita waste by consumers is between 95-115 kg a year in Europe and North America, while consumers in sub-Saharan Africa, south and south-eastern Asia, each throw away only 6-11 kg a year.</p>
